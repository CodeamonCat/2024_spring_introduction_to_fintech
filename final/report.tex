\section{Introduction}
This is the final research report of the Introduction to FinTech Course (Spring 2024, National Taiwan University). This research report aims to thoroughly examine the technical implementation details of the Relief Link project, evaluate its wide-ranging applicability and feasibility, and offer informed recommendations based on our findings. Relief Link project is the winner of the Worldcoin - Best Public Goods Use Case and ETHGlobal - ETHGlobal Sydney Finalist, and the project aims to solve the problem of real-time disaster monitoring and automated distribution aid, ensuring timely delivery of aid and emergency relief materials to those affected communities within a specific radius after a disaster.

\section{Background}
One of the primary challenges in emergency relief operations is the effective allocation of limited relief materials to the impacted communities. This challenge is often exacerbated by issues such as the inability to accurately assess the demand and utility of relief materials and the potential for malicious actions by some stakeholders, leading to ad-hoc and inefficient distribution \cite{b1}. Consequently, establishing an unalterable and globally accessible record of relief needs and allocations is crucial for efficient management.

Relief Link is an innovative service designed to automatically distribute aid immediately after a disaster, leveraging blockchain technology for efficient and secure operations. The project integrates Chainlink oracles for real-time disaster monitoring and automated transactions, ensuring timely delivery of aid to those affected within a specific radius. The system attracts users, even those new to cryptocurrency, through account abstraction from Unlimit and third-party networks, allowing for convenient access to fiat currency options.

Relief Link uses Worldcoin for authentication to maintain system integrity and prevent fraud, ensuring that aid is distributed once per verified user. The Relief Link platform leverages PredictHQs API to track and analyze the impact of various natural disasters (such as floods, fires, and earthquakes) within 100 kilometers of the users registered location. This data is visualized on the website, providing insights into recent disaster trends in the Asia-Pacific region.

\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Chainlink Oracles}
Chainlink oracles are a crucial component of the Relief Link platform. Chainlink is a blockchain initiative aimed at linking various networks and protocols via oracles, which are third-party services supplying smart contracts with external data. Since smart contracts cannot actively retrieve real-world data, the role of oracles here acts as API interfaces or intermediaries between blockchains and real-world information, connecting DeFi smart contracts on the blockchains with real-world data and enabling smart contracts to access and interact with external data. With the mechanism, Chainlink Oracles' objective is to support all blockchains, enabling the global transfer of data across different blockchains. In other words, Chainlink can successfully connect blockchains to the real world.

Chainlink, the leading platform for decentralized oracle systems, facilitates the transmission of real-world data to blockchains. It has developed a multi-node distributed information aggregator, akin to Bitcoin's mechanism, to ensure the provision of reliable and tamper-proof data for DeFi smart contracts on the blockchain. With its decentralized, secure, open-sourced, and reliable characteristics, Chainlink oracles are ideal for integration into the Relief Link platform.

In the Relief Link project, these oracles provide real-time data on natural disasters, allowing the system to monitor and respond to events promptly after verifying the reliability of the source data. The oracles collect information from various sources, such as weather stations and seismic sensors, and feed it into the Relief Link system. This data is then used to trigger automated transactions and distribute aid to affected areas. This integration ensures that aid distributions are triggered briskly and accurately when conditions meet predefined criteria, which is custom logic automation, offering transparency and reliability which are crucial for disaster response.

\subsection{Worldcoin(WLD)}
To ensure the integrity and fairness of aid distribution within the Relief Link platform, they have integrated Worldcoin's advanced identity verification technology. Worldcoin utilizes a unique system of iris biometric scanning through orb-shaped devices, which securely verifies the identity of each recipient.

The recipients are required to undergo an iris scan using Worldcoin's orb-shaped scanners, and the biometric data is then used to create a unique digital identity for each recipient, ensuring that each individual can only be registered once. Following the iris scan, a World ID is generated for each recipient. This World ID serves as a secure and reliable means of authentication, which can be used to verify the recipient's identity during the distribution of aid. To access their aid, recipients must provide their World ID and use the Worldcoin app. All personal data collected during this process is encrypted and stored securely, adhering to stringent privacy standards to protect the recipients' information.

This method is critical in preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that resources are allocated accurately and equitably. By ensuring that each recipient is uniquely identified and verified, Worldcoin's technology prevents duplication and fraudulent claims. This enhances the overall transparency and accountability of the aid distribution process, fostering trust among stakeholders and beneficiaries. Continuous monitoring and periodic audits are conducted to ensure compliance with data protection regulations and to address any issues related to privacy or security.

\subsection{Unlimit}
Unlimit is a third-party network that provides account abstraction services for the Relief Link platform. Account abstraction allows users to access insurance products and receive aid from the Relief Link system, even if they are new to cryptocurrency or blockchain technology. It acts as an intermediary between the Relief Link platform and traditional banking services, allowing users to convert their fiat currency into cryptocurrencies or fund their wallets easily. This makes it easier for users to access their insurance products or buying aids from the Relief Link platform immediately.

After integrating Unlimit into the Relief Link platform, users first need to set up an account and obtain an API key. This key allows the platform to access Unlimit's services and convert funds between different currencies. Once the API key is obtained, they can start providing account abstraction services to users. This process is automated using smart contracts on the blockchain, which trigger transactions based on predefined conditions. For instance, when a user requests to fund their wallets from their Worldcoin wallet, the system can automatically convert their fiat currency to the required cryptocurrencies.

Unlimit's account abstraction services are essential for the Relief Link platform, as they allow users to access their funds and receive aid conveniently and securely. By leveraging Unlimit's network, the platform can ensure that users have easy requests for the emergency aids and can use them for their intended purpose.

\section{Nouns DAO}
Relief Link team also collaborates with Nouns DAO, introducing a unique cultural and community aspect through the use of Nouns avatars. These avatars not only improve the user experience but also cultivate a sense of community and belonging, which is crucial during disaster recovery.

Nouns DAO operates as a decentralized autonomous organization, offering unique avatars to users of the Relief Link platform. These avatars significantly enhance user interaction and foster a strong sense of community among users, which is essential for disaster recovery.

The avatars are created through a blend of generative art and blockchain technology, resulting in unique and customizable characters for each user. Users can utilize these avatars to represent themselves on the Relief Link platform and engage with other members of the community.

To integrate Nouns DAO with the Relief Link platform, the first step is to set up an account and obtain an API key. This key grants access to Nouns DAO's services, allowing us to generate avatars for platform users. Once the API key is acquired, the process of providing avatars to users can commence. This process is automated through the use of smart contracts on the blockchain, which initiate transactions based on predefined conditions. For instance, when a user registers on the platform, the system can automatically create a unique avatar for them.

Nouns DAO's avatars are a crucial element of the Relief Link platform, enhancing the user experience and fostering a sense of community and belonging among users. By utilizing Nouns DAO's technology, we ensure that users feel connected and supported throughout the disaster recovery process.

\section{Technical Details}
